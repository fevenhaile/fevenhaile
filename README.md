## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**fevenhaile/fevenhaile** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m up to any project that has an impact on humanity and life in general.
ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Frontend Development.
ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on React and Next.js projects.
ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with implementing authentication in Next.js, specifically integrating Google authentication using NextAuth.
ğŸ’¬ Ask me about using React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, or handling API interactions in a React app.
âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy working on projects that can have a positive impact on people's lives!
